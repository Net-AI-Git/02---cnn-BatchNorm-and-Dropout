## 📋 Description

A comprehensive deep learning research study investigating the effects of different BatchNormalization and Dropout placement strategies in Convolutional Neural Networks. This project systematically compares 6 carefully designed CNN architectures on the Fashion-MNIST dataset to answer critical questions about regularization technique ordering and placement.

The study addresses fundamental questions in deep learning architecture design:
- How does BatchNorm placement (pre vs post-activation) affect convergence?
- What is the optimal order of BatchNorm and Dropout operations?
- How do different regularization strategies impact model generalization?

## 🎯 Key Research Questions

1. **BatchNorm Placement**: Comparing pre-activation vs post-activation BatchNormalization
2. **Regularization Order**: Testing BatchNorm-first vs Dropout-first strategies
3. **Convergence Analysis**: Evaluating training stability and generalization performance
4. **Parameter Efficiency**: Analyzing the trade-off between model complexity and performance
