## 📋 Description

A comprehensive deep learning research study investigating the effects of different BatchNormalization and Dropout placement strategies in Convolutional Neural Networks. This project systematically compares 6 carefully designed CNN architectures on the Fashion-MNIST dataset to answer critical questions about regularization technique ordering and placement.

The study addresses fundamental questions in deep learning architecture design:
- How does BatchNorm placement (pre vs post-activation) affect convergence?
- What is the optimal order of BatchNorm and Dropout operations?
- How do different regularization strategies impact model generalization?

## 🎯 Key Research Questions

1. **BatchNorm Placement**: Comparing pre-activation vs post-activation BatchNormalization
2. **Regularization Order**: Testing BatchNorm-first vs Dropout-first strategies
3. **Convergence Analysis**: Evaluating training stability and generalization performance
4. **Parameter Efficiency**: Analyzing the trade-off between model complexity and performance

### Key Metrics Evaluated
- **Test Accuracy** - Final model performance on unseen data
- **Training Convergence** - Speed and stability of learning
- **Generalization Gap** - Difference between training and validation performance
- **Parameter Efficiency** - Performance per trainable parameter

### Research Findings

**🏆 Performance Rankings:**
1. **Dropout-First Regularization: 91.79%** - Best overall performance
2. **Modern Baseline: 90.78%** - Strong baseline without regularization
3. **Post-Activation BatchNorm: 90.15%** - Classic approach with instability
4. **Classical Regularization: 88.82%** - Standard but efficient convergence
5. **BatchNorm-First Regularization: 88.38%** - Stable but lower performance
6. **Pre-Activation BatchNorm: 88.02%** - Lowest performance despite modern approach

**🔍 Key Insights:**

**Training Stability Analysis:**
- **Dropout-First** showed the most stable training with excellent train-validation alignment
- **Post-Activation BatchNorm** exhibited significant instability with validation loss spikes
- **Classical Regularization** achieved fastest convergence (early stopping at epoch 6)
- **Modern Baseline** demonstrated smooth learning without regularization artifacts

**Regularization Order Impact:**
- **Dropout-First strategy outperformed BatchNorm-First by 3.41 percentage points**
- Applying stochastic regularization before normalization appears to improve feature learning
- The hypothesis that "normalize first, then regularize" was disproven by empirical results

**BatchNorm Placement Effects:**
- **Post-activation placement** (90.15%) slightly outperformed **pre-activation** (88.02%)
- Pre-activation showed better stability but lower final accuracy
- Classical post-activation approach remains competitive for Fashion-MNIST

**Convergence Patterns:**
- Models with dropout showed more consistent validation performance
- BatchNorm-only models exhibited more training instability
- Early stopping was most effective with classical regularization (6 epochs vs 10-12)
